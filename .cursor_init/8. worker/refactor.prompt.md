# Night Shift — Refactor phase

Focus on **refactoring**: improve structure, naming, and patterns **without changing behaviour**. Prefer small, safe steps.

- Do not add new features or fix bugs in this phase; only improve existing code.
- Rename for clarity, extract functions/components, simplify conditionals, reduce duplication.
- Keep the same public behaviour and contracts so existing tests still pass.
- Consult `.cursor/8. worker/night-shift.prompt.md` for the main night shift workflow; this file adds the refactor focus.

*Edit `.cursor/8. worker/refactor.prompt.md` to adapt the refactor-phase prompt.*
