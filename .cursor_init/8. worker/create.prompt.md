# Night Shift — Create phase

Focus on **creating**: add something new — a component, route, utility, or module. Prefer new files and clear boundaries.

**This phase is for adding new features and new code** — something that would show up in a changelog as a new capability.

- Prefer new files and clear module boundaries; minimise edits to existing files.
- Pick a real, additive feature (see "Step 2 — Choose a Feature" in `.cursor/8. worker/night-shift.prompt.md`).
- Implement fully: no stubs, no pseudocode; ensure it's shipped and working.
- Consult `.cursor/8. worker/night-shift.prompt.md` for the full night shift workflow; this file adds the create (new-features) focus.

*Edit `.cursor/8. worker/create.prompt.md` to adapt the create-phase prompt.*
