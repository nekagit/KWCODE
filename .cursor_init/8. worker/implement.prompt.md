# Night Shift — Implement phase

Focus on **implementation**: build the feature end-to-end (UI, API, or both). Prefer new files; wire into existing code only where necessary.

**This phase is for extending existing features and code** — not for adding brand-new product features. Implement the behaviour that is already specified or partially built.

- Prefer new files and modules; wire into existing code only where strictly needed (e.g. registering a route, adding an export).
- Follow the project's layout, naming, and tech stack (see `.cursor/1. project/`, `.cursor/2. agents/`).
- Deliver complete, working behaviour; no stubs or TODOs.
- Consult `.cursor/8. worker/night-shift.prompt.md` for the main night shift workflow; this file adds the implement (extend-existing) focus.

*Edit `.cursor/8. worker/implement.prompt.md` to adapt the implement-phase prompt.*
