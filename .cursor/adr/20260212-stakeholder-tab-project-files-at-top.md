# ADR: Stakeholder tab – Project Files section at top

## Date
2026-02-12

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In the Stakeholder tab, the Project Files section (files in .cursor directory) was rendered at the bottom of the grid, after Design, Ideas, Architecture, and Testing.

## Decision
- Move the **Project Files** section to the **top** of the Stakeholder tab content.
- Order is now: Project Files (full width) → Design, Ideas → Architecture, Testing.

## Consequences
- Project Files is the first thing users see in the Stakeholder tab, making repo/.cursor file access more prominent.
