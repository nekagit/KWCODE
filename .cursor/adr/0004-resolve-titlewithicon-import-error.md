Addressing the build error where `TitleWithIcon.tsx` was expected at `src/components/atoms/headers/TitleWithIcon.tsx` but was actually located at `src/components/shared/TitleWithIcon.tsx`. To resolve this without moving the shared component, an `index.ts` file was created in `src/components/atoms/headers/` to re-export `TitleWithIcon` from its correct location. This satisfies the build system's expectation while maintaining the established `shared` component pattern.
