# ADR 033: Template ideas and AI-generated full project from idea

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Users want to start from an idea and have the rest of a project (prompts, tickets, features, design, architecture) generated by AI. They also want a fixed set of template ideas to choose from, and the ability to generate a full project from any saved idea (not only templates).

## Decision

- **10 template ideas**
  - Add `src/data/template-ideas.ts` with 10 predefined ideas: SaaS analytics dashboard, QR digital business card, Team task board (Kanban), Event calendar & booking, Documentation site, SaaS landing page, Mini e‑commerce, API developer portal, Community forum, Internal ops tool.
  - Each has: id, title, description, category (saas, webapp, website, webshop, etc.).
- **Generate project from idea API**
  - Add `POST /api/generate-project-from-idea` with body either:
    - `{ idea: { title, description, category } }` — creates the idea in ideas.json (if not already saved), then generates from it; or
    - `{ ideaId: number }` — loads the idea from ideas.json and generates from it.
  - One OpenAI call returns a single JSON object: prompts (5–8), tickets (15–25), features (15–25, with ticketIndexes and promptIndexes), design (full DesignConfig), architectures (1).
  - API persists: new prompts, tickets, features, one design, one architecture; creates one project linking the idea and all new entities. Returns `{ project, counts }`.
- **UI**
  - **Projects page**: accordion “Start from a template idea (AI generates full project)” with 10 cards from `TEMPLATE_IDEAS`; each card has “Generate with AI” button. On success: refetch projects and redirect to the new project.
  - **Ideas page (My ideas)**: each saved idea gets a “Generate project” button that calls the API with `{ ideaId }`; on success: toast and redirect to the new project.
- **ADR**
  - Document in `nenad/adr` and `.cursor/adr`.

## Consequences

- Users can pick one of 10 template ideas and get a full project (prompts, tickets, features, design, architecture) in one click.
- Users can link any saved idea to a new project by generating from it on the Ideas page.
- Single AI call keeps latency and token usage bounded; all entities are created and linked in one flow.
