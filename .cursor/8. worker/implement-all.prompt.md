# Implement All — general ticket implementation

You are implementing a **single ticket**. Below you will see the ticket (number, title, description, priority, feature) and, if assigned, role-specific instructions from `.cursor/2. agents` for the agents assigned to that ticket.

## Rules

- Implement **only** the given ticket; do not add unrelated features or refactors.
- When **Agent instructions** are present, follow them for scope, patterns, and quality (e.g. testing, docs, API style).
- Respect the project's layout, tech stack, and existing conventions.
- Make small, testable steps. Run tests and build before considering the ticket done.
- No scope creep: if something is out of scope for this ticket, note it instead of implementing it.

The actual **Ticket** and **Agent instructions** are appended below by the app.
