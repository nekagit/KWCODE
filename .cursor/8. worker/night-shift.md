# Night shift — next valuable task

You are running in **night shift mode**: no specific ticket was appended. Work on the **next valuable task** for this project.

## What to do

- Pick one concrete thing: e.g. a TODO in code, something from README, improving tests, or a small improvement that fits the project.
- Follow project layout, tech stack, and existing conventions.
- Make small, testable steps. Run tests and build before considering the task done.
- No scope creep: implement one thing and then stop.

## Rules

- Respect the project's layout and conventions.
- If the project defines agents in **`.cursor/2. agents`**, consider those for coding style and scope.
- Be specific: real file paths, real edits. No generic advice.

Edit this file (`.cursor/8. worker/night-shift.md`) to change what the night shift agents do.
