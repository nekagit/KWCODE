## Summary: Done vs missing

### Done

| Area | What's implemented |
|------|--------------------|
| Dashboard | Tabbed home: quick actions, ticket kanban (backlog/in progress/done/blocked), prompts, active repos, link to Run. |
| Tickets | CRUD; status and priority; drag-and-drop; Add ticket accordion; paginated table; AI generate from description/PDF. |
| Features | Define features (title, tickets, prompts, projects); run one or add to queue; filter by project. |
| Run | Select prompts and projects; run script (Tauri); live log; run by feature; stop; feature queue (run in order). |
| Projects | List from API/Tauri; create from template/idea/path; delete; detail with accordions (prompts, tickets, features, ideas, design, architecture). |
| Project spec | specFiles, specFilesTickets, specFilesFeatures; Project Spec list; drag to Tickets/Features cards; preview; link/unlink. |
| Todos tab | Display .cursor/tickets.md and .cursor/features.md; Sync button (validate correlation); Archive (Tauri); Analysis: Tickets / Features buttons. |
| Kanban | Parse features.md + tickets.md to JSON; Features (To do/Done) and Tickets (P0–P3) columns; Copy JSON. |
| API file read | GET projects/[id]/file?path= for repo files (e.g. .cursor/tickets.md); path safety and repo inside cwd check. |
| Error handling | getApiErrorMessage for API responses; user-friendly messages instead of raw 500. |
| Configuration | Timing parameters for run script; UI theme templates (design templates) with localStorage persistence. |
| Export & analysis | Project export (markdown); Cursor best practice; Analysis prompt from design/architecture/tickets. |
| Design, Architecture, Ideas, Prompts | CRUD; AI generate; library and project linking. |
| Root loading overlay | Initial loading until run store is hydrated; theme applied before paint. |

### Missing or incomplete

| Area | Gap |
|------|-----|
| tickets.md / features.md content | Current files are placeholders; no real checklist items or feature list derived from codebase. |
| API validation | Request bodies not validated (e.g. Zod); 500 on bad input instead of 400 with clear errors. |
| API auth | No auth for /api/* when deployed beyond localhost. |
| Run history | Run metadata and log snippets not persisted; no History view. |
| OPENAI in UI | No clear message when OPENAI_API_KEY is missing on generate actions. |
| Tests | No unit/integration tests for lib/store; no E2E for critical flows. |
| Error boundaries | No React error boundaries; uncaught errors can cause full white screen. |
| Accessibility | Focus, keyboard nav, ARIA not audited for custom tables and Kanban. |
| Project sync | No explicit "Reload from disk" for local projects vs projects.json. |
| i18n | No locale/translation layer. |
| Offline / PWA | No service worker or offline support for browser mode. |

## Prioritized work items (tickets)

### P0 — Critical / foundation

#### Feature: Tickets and features format

- [x] #1 Populate tickets.md with work items from codebase — Checklist by feature (P0–P3) so Kanban and Tickets card have real content.
- [x] #2 Populate features.md from tickets.md — Features roadmap with ticket refs so correlation and Kanban parse correctly.

#### Feature: Project details — Todos tab and Kanban

- [x] #3 Keep Sync button validating features.md and tickets.md correlation — Per .cursor/sync.md; show clear sync status and details.
- [x] #4 Ensure Analysis: Tickets creates both tickets.md and features.md in one run — So feature names and ticket numbers stay aligned.

### P1 — High / quality and maintainability

#### Feature: API and error handling

- [x] #5 Add request validation (e.g. Zod) to API routes — Return 400 with clear errors instead of 500 on invalid input.
- [x] #6 Add API auth for /api/* when deployed beyond localhost — API key header or session.
- [x] #7 Surface OPENAI_API_KEY missing state in UI — Clear message on generate buttons or after first failure.

#### Feature: Run and scripts

- [x] #8 Persist run history (metadata + log snippets) — SQLite or JSON; add History view on Run or dedicated page.

#### Feature: Quality and maintainability

- [x] #9 Add unit/integration tests for lib and store — Jest or Vitest.
- [x] #10 Add E2E tests for critical flows — Playwright or Cypress (e.g. run, create project).
- [x] #11 Add React error boundaries at layout or route level — Avoid full white screen on uncaught errors.
- [x] #12 Accessibility audit and fixes — Focus, keyboard nav, ARIA for custom tables and Kanban.

### P2 — Medium / polish and scale

#### Feature: Polish and scale

- [x] #13 Project sync / Reload from disk — Explicit reload for local projects vs projects.json.
- [x] #14 i18n / locale layer — If app will be used in multiple languages.
- [x] #15 Offline / PWA support for browser mode — Service worker; consider sync when online.

### P3 — Lower / later

#### Feature: Later

- [x] #16 Copy Kanban JSON to file in browser mode — When Tauri not available, allow saving JSON to a file (e.g. download).
- [x] #17 Export run log to file from Run page — Download log for current or past run.

## Next steps

1. Run Analysis: Tickets from the project details Todos tab (or use this file as the baseline) to refresh tickets.md and features.md from the codebase when priorities change.
2. Check off completed tickets with `[x]` in tickets.md and keep features.md in sync (same feature names and ticket refs).
3. Use Sync on the Todos tab to validate correlation and refresh Kanban; use Archive (Tauri) before a full reset.
4. Tackle P0 (#1–#4) so the project has real ticket/feature content and reliable Analysis/Sync behavior.
5. Add validation and auth (P1 #5–#6) before exposing the app beyond localhost.
6. Add tests and error boundaries (P1 #9–#11) to improve reliability and debuggability.

*Based on codebase as of analysis. Update this file as work is completed or priorities change. Check off items with `[x]` when done.*
