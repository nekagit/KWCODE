# run-prompts

**Name:** run-prompts

**Description:** run-prompts is a Next.js application with a Tauri desktop shell. It provides a modern web UI (App Router, Tailwind, Radix/shadcn) and optional native desktop builds. The project supports development (web and Tauri), linting, E2E testing with Playwright, and cursor/scaffolding utilities (e.g. `scaffold:cursor-md`, Tailwind extraction scripts). It is aimed at developers and teams who want a single codebase for web and desktop with a component-based frontend and scriptable workflows.
