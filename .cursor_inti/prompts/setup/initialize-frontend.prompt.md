# Prompt: Initialize frontend

Use when setting up or bootstrapping the frontend for this project.

## Context

- Framework, styling, state, routing, and testing choices are defined there.

## Instructions

1. Read the frontend setup JSON and TECH-STACK.
2. Scaffold or update the frontend: app shell, routing, theme, base components.
3. Ensure dev server runs and build passes.
4. Update `.cursor/setup/frontend.json` if you add routes or entities.

## Output

- Working frontend app (or delta if augmenting).
- Any new routes/entities reflected in setup JSON.
