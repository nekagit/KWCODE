# ADR template: Testing strategy

## Status

Draft (template)

## Context

(Why we need a testing strategy: coverage goals, CI, E2E vs unit balance.)

## Decision

(Chosen approach: e.g. "Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E; coverage threshold 80% for critical paths.")

## Consequences

- Positive: (quality, regression safety)
- Negative: (maintenance, flakiness risk)
- Neutral: (tooling, docs)
