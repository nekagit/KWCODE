# script

Build and dev scripts: wait-dev-server, build-for-tauri, tauri-with-local-target, extract-tailwind-* codemods, scaffold-cursor-md, copy-build-to-desktop, setup-documentation, initialize-project. Worker scripts under `worker/` (implement_all, run_terminal_agent) are used by the Tauri backend.
