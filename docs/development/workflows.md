# Workflows

- **Tickets** — Managed in `.cursor/7. planner/tickets.md`; use the app's Kanban or Run tab.
- **Agents** — Role definitions in `.cursor/2. agents/`; assign per ticket when generating prompts.
- **Milestones** — See `.cursor/milestones/`; link to planner tickets.
- **Worker queue** — `.cursor/worker/queue/` and `.cursor/worker/workflows/ticket-workflow.md`.
- **Implement All** — Run tab terminal slots show script exit status when a run finishes: "Done" / "Done in Xs" for success, "Failed (exit N)" for non-zero exit.
