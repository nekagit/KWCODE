# Creating features

1. Use `.cursor/planner/ticket-templates/feature-ticket.template.md` to draft a ticket.
2. Add the ticket to `.cursor/planner/tickets.md` (or use the app's ticket generation and Sync).
3. Link to a milestone in `.cursor/milestones/` if applicable.
4. Run Implement All from the Run tab or work through the ticket manually.
