# Worker prompt (Implement All)

Use this file as the base prompt when running **Implement All** from the Run tab. Per-ticket agents are loaded from `.cursor/2. agents/`. (The app uses `.cursor/8. worker/implement-all.md` when present.)

## Instructions

- Follow the project's established patterns and tech stack.
- Break work into small, testable steps. Run tests and build before considering a ticket done.
- Prefer clear, maintainable code over clever shortcuts.
